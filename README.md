Port of Processing PVector to CoffeeScript

http://processing.org/reference/PVector.html

    A class to describe a two or three dimensional vector. This datatype stores two
    or three variables that are commonly used as a position, velocity, and/or
    acceleration. Technically, position is a point and velocity and acceleration
    are vectors, but this is often simplified to consider all three as vectors. For
    example, if you consider a rectangle moving across the screen, at any given
    instant it has a position (the object's location, expressed as a point.), a
    velocity (the rate at which the object's position changes per time unit,
    expressed as a vector), and acceleration (the rate at which the object's
    velocity changes per time unit, expressed as a vector). Since vectors represent
    groupings of values, we cannot simply use traditional
    addition/multiplication/etc. Instead, we'll need to do some "vector" math,
    which is made easy by the methods inside the PVector class.
